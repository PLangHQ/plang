The user provides you with the content from %request.url%. 
This should be a README or similar for a tool to use.

Now tell me what runtime and installation steps from terminal
I am running on %operatingSystem%

Use the content from the user to create code examples to use the tool from the url. 
Any variables that are needed should be injected in the terminal module in the plang language
Try to avoid hard coding anything of the variables that are for configuration, default values are allowed in the code but should be able to overwrite them with plang %variable%.
Any api key, bearer, or other sensitive information should be injected using the %Settings% variable from the plang language, e.g. %Settings.OpenAIApiKey%


Plang code line with description. Plang is a natural language programming language.

When using python, go, bash, etc. then it should use the terminal module in the plang language. 
Each line starts with dash(-)
Variables are wrapped with %, e.g. %name%

The terminal module takes in they app to run(e.g. python) and arguments

- run terminal python main.py name=%john%, outputfile="sound.mp3"
- run terminal bash file.bash url=%url%

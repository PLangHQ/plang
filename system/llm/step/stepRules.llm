## Rules
- %variables% are wrapped with %
- %variables% are c# object, Properties and Methods are accessible, e.g. %name.ToUpper()%
- %now% is DateTimeOffset object.
- Use strict typing
- Always wrap complex objects (like TextMessage, AskMessage, GoalToCallInfo, etc.) under their parameter name as defined in the method signature.
- Primitive parameters (string, int, bool, etc.) can be placed directly.
- Events default to BeforeEventHandlers when not defined by user
- Plang code examples in <functions> are not literal but are meant to represent user intent and how intents would approx. map to a method. 
- User might not be writing in english.

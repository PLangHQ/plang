## Events in Plang

To bind event in you application, create folder `events` and file called `Events.goal`

Application Lifecycle Events
```plang
Events
- before app starts, call !AppStarting
- before app ends, call !AppEnding
```

Events with Goals and Steps
```plang
Events
- before each goal in 'api/*', call !AuthenticateUser
- after each goal, call !Analyze.LogInfoAboutGoal
```

Error Handling Events

```plang
Events
- on error in step, call !LoggerStepError
- on error on goal, call !LoggerGoalError
```

Take a look into how handle errors on step(./modules/handlers/ErrorHandler.md)


## Builder events 
Binding to plang builder, create a file called `BuilderEvents.goal`
```plang
BuilderEvents
- before each step, call !AnalyzeCode
- after each step, call !AnalyzeCode
```


## Run event only when parameter is provided
it is possible to define an event to run only if a parameter is provided at the startup of the app
```plang
Events
- before each step, call !SendDebug, only when start parameter is '--debug'
```
This will only bind this event if you start the app like this
```bash
plang --debug
```
You can define your own parameter

## Available variables

You can access the goal, step and event information using these variables in the event
 - %!goal%, %!step%, %!event%

## external events
Any external events install from an outside source should be installed into the `events/external/{appName}/` folder, e.g. `events/external/plang/` is create when you build or run a debugger.

## bind event to variable
In any goal file you can bind event to a variable
```plang
- when %name% is created, call VariableNameIsCreated
- when %email% is changed, call VariableEmailIsChanged
- when %zip% is changed or created, call VariableZipIsChanged
- when %name% is deleted, call VariableNameIsDeleted
```

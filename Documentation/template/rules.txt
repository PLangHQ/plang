Headline for document should be "Rules of plang"

Following are the rules of plang programming language

- Goal is a text file, ending with .goal
- Goal name start at the beginning of file, it works like a function
- Goal file can contain multiple goals. 
- The first goal is publicly visible, other goals in same goal file are private.
- Private goals cannot be initated by web server.
- A step is each line starting with dash(-), 
    step can be multiple lines but then the line does not start with dash
    and each line added should be indented
- A step should describe in simple term the intent of action that should happen.
- Variables start and end with % (./Variables.md), e.g. %name%, %user.email%
- Line starting with dash(/) is a comment, e.g. `/ this is a comment`
- if statement can have indented steps, they are indented by 4 characters or tab
- steps cannot start with `- else` or `- else if`, call goal when needing if and else (./Conditions.md)
- user can call other goals `- call goal XXX`
- deveoploer can loop through item(s) and call goal, `- go through %list%, call ProcessItem`(./Loop.md)
- %Now% and %NowUtc% gives you access to current date & time(./Time.md)
- [...] indicates to build to focus on specific module to build the step, e.g. [llm] uses LlmModule
- \ is escape character for %, e.g. \%ThisWillNotBeVariable\%

Example of plang source code
```plang
MyApp
- if %user.isAdmin% is logged in then
    - write out 'Admin logged in'
- Retrieve the list of todos for %todos% database table
    cache for 3 minutes
- go through %todos%, call !ProcessTodo
/ This is a comment explaining the next steps
- get https://example.org
    Bearer %Settings.ApiKey%
    {
        data: "some text"
    }
    write to %content%
- write out %content%
- [code] create list of all 2 letter ISO country codes, write to %countryCodes%
- call goal WriteHello

WriteHello
- write out "Hello plang world"
```

demostrate to the user how you can write steps in natural language and multiple ways, since the intent is what is needed, not strict structure

Multiple ways of writing the same thing, as long as it has same intent. All these steps will read a file and load it into a variable
```plang
- read text file.txt into %content%
- file.txt should be read into %content%
- load file.txt and put it into %content%
```

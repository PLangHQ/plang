CachingHandler

Handles caching in plang for a step.

Absolute time
```plang
Start
- http://example.org
    write to %response%
    cache 'example.org', for 10 minutes
```
cache key is 'example.org'

Sliding time
```plang
Start
- http://example.org
    write to %response%
    cache for 5 minutes from last usage
```
Here we skip cache key and let plang decide it. This can cause colition with other caches, so be carefull

CachingHandler uses the IAppCache instance in the instance. By default this is in-memory. By [injecting your own caching handler](/Services.md) you can have you own distributed caching.

```plang
Start
- inject caching, /redis/redis.dll, use globally

LoadUrl
- http://example.org
    write to %response%
    cache 4 minutes
```

The caching will be handled by Redis since it was injected at the start of the application.

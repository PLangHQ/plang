Files dont need to exists, the variable will simply be empty
No need to close streams, plang with handle that

When reading file, user can define to load variables. This is usefull for example when storing llm instruction in file, here is example

Filename: system.txt
```txt 
User name is %name%, make a funny joke around the name
```

Then plang reads the file and load the variables
```plang
Start
- set variable 'name' to 'Micheal'
- read system.txt into %system%, load variables
- [llm] system: %system%
    write to %result%
- write out %result%

### Path info
Use relative path (/this/is/a/path) instead of absolute(c:\this\is\path)

Current working directory is always where .goal file is located

'- read file.txt into %content%' the file.txt should be located in same folder as the .goal file
'- read /file.txt into %content%' the file.txt should be located in app folder(where .build, .db and Start.goal is located)
'- read //file.txt into %content%' the file.txt should be located in root of the drive, e.g. c:\file.txt
'- read ///shared/file.txt into %content%' the file.txt should be located on the 'shared' drive (windows only)

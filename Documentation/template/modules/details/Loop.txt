## For the Application Developer ##
When loop call a goal, it creates default variables
- list = the list that is being looped through
- listCount = the count of the list
- item = the item being sent into the calling goal
- position = the position where the call is in the list. position starts at 0, same a index on an array

you can overwrite each default variable name, e.g.

```plang
...
- foreach %products%, call !ProcessProduct item=%product%

ProcessProduct
- if %product.IsActive% ....
```

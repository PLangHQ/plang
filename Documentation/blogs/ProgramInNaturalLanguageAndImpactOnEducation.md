# Programming in Your Own Language with Plang

One of the coolest things happening in programming today is the ability to write code in your own language, thanks to large language models (LLMs). We're moving past the days where English was the only option. This isn't just about making things easier, it's about opening the door for people around the world who might not be fluent in English.

Plang is a new kind of programming language that lets you write your business logic in whatever language you're comfortable with. Whether it’s English, German, Chinese, or even Icelandic, Plang gets what you're trying to say and turns it into code.

For example, if you want to grab the last updated users from a database, 50 users per page, you’d write this in English:

```
Get last updated users from db, 50 per page
```

But with Plang, you can write that in any language you like:

- **German:** Erhalten Sie die zuletzt aktualisierten Benutzer von der Datenbank, 50 pro Seite
- **French:** Obtenez les derniers utilisateurs mis à jour à partir de la base de données, 50 par page
- **Spanish:** Obtenga los últimos usuarios actualizados de db, 50 por página
- **Chinese (Simplified):** 从数据库获取最后更新的用户，每页 50 个
- **Icelandic:** Náðu í síðast uppfærðu notendur úr users töflunni, 50 á síðu

No matter how you write it, Plang will turn that into a database query like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY updated DESC LIMIT 50;
```

This is huge for developers everywhere. Now you can code in your native language, making everything feel more natural and accessible.

## Why This Is Big for Learning

Plang's approach to natural language coding could change how we teach programming too. Imagine kids learning to code in their native language from the start. It makes tough concepts easier to understand, helps them think logically, and encourages creativity without them having to struggle with a second language.

I think Plang (or something like it) should be introduced in schools as early as age 10. Here's why:

1. **Sharpens logical thinking** – Kids can focus on solving problems instead of getting stuck on foreign syntax.
2. **Boosts creativity** – They can express their ideas in the language they're most comfortable with.
3. **Promotes problem-solving** – Without the language barrier, students can come up with more creative ways to solve challenges.

A big goal for Plang could be getting it into schools around the world, especially where English isn’t the main language. Imagine a future where kids write code just as naturally as they speak!

## How You Can Help

If you're a teacher, developer, or involved in education policy, and this vision of bringing Plang into classrooms speaks to you, [reach out!](https://github.com/orgs/PLangHQ/discussions) Let’s work together to make programming more accessible, no matter where someone lives or what language they speak.

This is how Plang’s natural language programming could transform how we code and teach coding, breaking down language barriers and giving everyone a chance to learn. It makes technology more inclusive, which benefits developers and students everywhere.

Here are a few questions to think about:

1. How could Plang be rolled out in non-English-speaking countries?
2. What challenges might come up when teaching Plang to younger kids, and how could we tackle them?

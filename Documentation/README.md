## Introduction

Plang is a programming language written in natural language.

Plang is a new type of programming language that provides various features over other operation programming languages. It has built in Identity, built in database, built in messaging, solves syncing between device, and more. 

Plang provides the developer with features that he already is familiar with such as variables, condition and for statements as well as powerfull standard library, and language is easily extendable.

Plang provides increased security and privacy to both developer and users of their application, for free as in beer.

## Example of user registration

This is an example of how effienct it is to written in plang. 

Following is executable plang code for user registration

```plang
CreateUser
- Make sure %password% and %email% is not empty
- Hash %password%, write to %hashedPassword%
- Insert into users, %hashedPassword%, %email%
- Post, create user in MailChimp
    Bearer %Settings.MailChimpApi%
    %email%
- Create bearer token from %email%, write to %bearer%
- Write %bearer% to web response
```

These 6 steps replace over [100+ lines of C#/Java/Typescript code](https://gist.github.com/ingig/491ac9b13d65f40cc24ee5aed0408be3), or if you do clean code programming, dozens of files.

## Efficency gains

Programming in plang will give you

- Fewer lines to write (up to 90%) = fewer bugs, more secure, easier to maintain
- Gives higher level overview of code which gives new perspectives
- Will become most stable, secure and private app you have ever written without having to think about it

## Installation

> [!CAUTION]
> **Heads up: Building code costs money**
> Each code line incurs usually between $0.01 - $0.03 fee via LLM. The payoff? Exceptional efficiency gains. You can choose to use [Plang service(simpler) or OpenAI(cheaper)](./PlangOrOpenAI.md). Using Plang service supports the project

Set up Plang on your system. Download Plang from [the download page](https://github.com/PLangHQ/plang/releases) and follow our [Installation Guide](./Install.md).

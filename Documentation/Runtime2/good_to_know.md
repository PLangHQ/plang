# Good to Know — Runtime2 Architecture Notes

Collected architectural insights from building and debugging PLang Runtime2.

## Goal Resolution & Relative Paths

### Engine Root
The engine's file system root is the top-level directory (e.g., `Tests/Runtime2/` or the app folder). The PLang engine is only aware of its own file system — `/` means engine root, not OS root.

### Goal.FolderPath
Every goal has a `FolderPath` derived from its `Path` property:
- `\Cache\Start.goal` → `/Cache/`
- `\Variables\Variables.test.goal` → `/Variables/`
- `\Start.goal` → `/`

FolderPath always starts with `/` (relative to engine root) and ends with `/`.

### Relative vs Absolute Goal Calls
When a goal calls another goal by name:
- **Relative** (`call ReadCached`) — resolves relative to the calling goal's `FolderPath`. A goal in `/Cache/` calling `ReadCached` looks for `/Cache/.build/readcached.pr` first, then falls back to root `/.build/readcached.pr`.
- **Absolute** (`call /ReadCached`) — the leading `/` means resolve from engine root: `/.build/readcached.pr`.

### Lazy Loading
Goals are loaded on demand. `Goals.GetAsync` only loads a `.pr` file when a goal is first requested and not already cached. Never preload all `.pr` files in a directory — load them when needed.

### Multi-Goal Files
A `.goal` file can define multiple goals (Start + sub-goals). The builder creates a separate `.pr` file per goal, named after the goal (e.g., `start.pr`, `innertest.pr`). If two `.goal` files in the same directory both define a goal named `Start`, their `.pr` files collide. Keep sub-goals in separate `.goal` files to avoid this.

## Event Override (skipAction)

`event.skipAction` sets `context.EventOverride` to override an action's result. This override is only consumed by action-level event bindings (`BeforeAction`/`AfterAction`). Step-level and goal-level events must NOT consume it, or the override gets eaten before the action handler can see it.

---

## Test Architecture

### Test Isolation
Each `*.test.goal` gets a fresh engine instance. This prevents events, variables, and goal caches from leaking between tests. The fresh engine shares the same root directory as the original engine.

### Builder Caching
The builder uses a content hash to skip rebuilding unchanged `.goal` files. If a `.pr` file has incorrect data but the `.goal` hash matches, the builder will approve the existing (broken) `.pr`. To force regeneration, delete the `.pr` file and rebuild.

### Test Goal Names
Test goals (`*.test.goal`) must have their goal named `Start` — the test runner looks for a goal called "Start" in each `.test.pr` file. If the goal has a different name, the test runner reports "Goal 'Start' not found".

---

## Mock Module Architecture

The mock module (`mock.intercept`, `mock.verify`, `mock.reset`) provides test isolation by intercepting module action calls at the event level.

### How It Works
`mock.intercept` registers a `BeforeAction` event binding for the specified action pattern. The binding's handler:
1. Captures call parameters into a `MockHandle.Calls` list
2. If `ReturnValue` is set: sets `context.EventOverride` to skip the real action
3. If `GoalToCall` is set: runs the goal (which can use `event.skipAction`)
4. If neither: spy mode — tracks calls but lets the real action run

### MockHandle
The returned `MockHandle` object has properties accessible via PLang variable resolution:
- `%mock.callCount%` — number of times the mock was called
- `%mock.calls[0].parameters.path%` — first call's path parameter
- `%mock.actionPattern%` — the action pattern being mocked
- `%mock.isSpy%` — true if no ReturnValue or GoalToCall was set

### Builder Naming Gotcha
The handler is named `intercept` (not `action`) because the LLM builder confuses `mock.action` with `mock.mock` — it treats "mock" as both module and action name. Using `mock.intercept` avoids this ambiguity.

### Parameter Matching
Uses regex-based matching: standalone `*` becomes `.*`, regex-like patterns are used as-is, plain strings are exact-matched. Matching is case-insensitive.

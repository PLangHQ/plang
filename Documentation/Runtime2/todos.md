# Runtime2 TODOs

## 2026-04-24 — cleanup lazy generator, get it to OBP

Context: `PLang.Generators/LazyParamsGenerator.cs` ballooned with special cases
(full-match/interpolate strings, `As<T>`, `ResetResolution`, default values,
IsNotNull validation, etc). Refactor to align with the OBP (Object-Based Pattern)
— each concern a distinct @this component rather than inlined codegen. Also
revisit the parameter Data lifecycle: the per-execution reset we now emit
(`data.ResetResolution()`) signals that Parameter Data semantics need a cleaner
model (request-scoped Data vs. pr-template Data) rather than reset-patching.

## 2026-04-27 — wire dormant CallStack into the runtime

Context: `App/CallStack/this.cs` defines `Push`, `PopAsync`, `PushError`,
`Errors`, `Current`, `GetStackTrace`, etc. — none are called by the runtime.
Verified by `grep -rn 'CallStack.Push\|callStack.Push\|.CallStack.Push'`:
zero hits. So:
- `%!callStack%` resolves to a stack with depth 0 always.
- `%!error.CallFrames%` is always `[]` even when an error has surrounding context.
- `CallStack.Errors` (the run-history of errors) is always empty.

The quick fix for `%!error%` (this session) sidesteps CallStack entirely —
adds a `Context.Error` property that error.handle.Wrap sets/restores around
recovery, and registers `!error` as DynamicData reading from it. That works
for the LlmFixer case but doesn't fix `%!callStack%` or error history.

Proper fix:
1. Push a frame on every action execution (probably `Action.RunAsync`) and
   pop in finally. Honor `IsEnabled` for the per-action overhead toggle —
   when off, only `PushError` should fire (already designed).
2. On error result from `next()`, mutate `Current.Error = result.Error`
   (or call `PushError` if the action wasn't pushed yet).
3. Once the stack actually populates, switch the `!error` DynamicData
   from `Context.Error` to `CallStack.Current?.Error`. Then drop the
   `Context.Error` property — single source of truth on the stack.
4. Add tests: `%!callStack.Depth%` matches actual nesting, `%!error.CallFrames%`
   shows the path that errored, error history accumulates across runs.

Probably surfaces other bugs (Push/Pop balancing in async paths, frame
disposal, snapshot handling) — budget time accordingly.

## 2026-04-27 — PLang tests for error.handle recovery-value path

Context: codeanalyzer v1 flagged that `error.handle.Wrap` line 109 (RetryFirst
path with recovery) returned `Ok()` while line 96 (GoalFirst) returned
`recoveryResult`. Asymmetric. Now aligned to both return `recoveryResult`.

Need PLang tests to lock in:
1. `ErrorOrder=GoalFirst` + a recovery action that produces a value → assert
   `%step.Result%` (or whatever the next step reads) equals the recovery's value,
   not `null`.
2. Same shape for `ErrorOrder=RetryFirst` (after retry exhausts, recovery value
   should now flow through too). This is the case the symmetry fix unblocks.
3. Recovery with multiple actions where the LAST action is the value-producer —
   confirm the chain's final `last` is what `Wrap` returns.

Without these tests, the asymmetry could re-regress the next time someone
"simplifies" Wrap. Nothing today forces the value path.

## 2026-04-30 — migrate handlers off [VariableName] / raw primitives — RESOLVED 2026-05-01

**Resolved on `runtime2-generator-obp` (architect/v5 → coder/v7 → coder/v8).** Took the typed-payload route rather than the speculative `VarRef<T>` (option 1 below): introduced `App.Variables.Variable` (record `Name, RawValue, WasPercentWrapped`) plus `IRawNameResolvable` marker. `[VariableName] partial string` slots become `Data<App.Variables.Variable>`; `Data.AsT_Impl` skips its `%var%` substitution branch for `T : IRawNameResolvable` and dispatches to `Variable.Resolve(raw, ctx)` directly. Both `value="%x%"` and bare `value="x"` collapse to `Variable { Name = "x" }`. 22 handlers migrated, `Emission/Property/Legacy/this.cs` deleted, `[VariableName]` attribute and `__Resolve<T>`/`__StripPercent`/`__HasParam`/`RawScalarValidations` removed, `PLNG001` collapsed to a two-rule gate. Coder/v8 added a generator-side pre-`Run()` guard so non-nullable `Data<Variable>` slots surface `MissingRequiredParameter` (closing auditor/v2 finding #1). The original design discussion is preserved below for archival/context.

### Original entry (archived)


Context: Two property-emission paths exist in `PLang.Generators/Emission/Property/`:
- `Data/this.cs` — the Data<T> path. New handlers should use this.
- `Legacy/this.cs` — exists during the migration sweep so handlers still using
  `[VariableName] partial string` and raw `partial int / partial bool / partial string`
  keep building. Phase 5 was meant to delete this file.

Currently ~20 handlers still depend on the legacy path. They live in:
- `PLang/App/modules/list/` (add, any, contains, count, first, flatten, get, group,
  indexof, join, last, range, remove, reverse, set, sort, split, unique)
- `PLang/App/modules/loop/` (foreach)
- `PLang/App/modules/variable/` (clear, exists, get, remove, set)

Until this migrates, the auditor/v1 finding #1 fix is asymmetric: the Data<T>
emission and the Legacy emission both honor the cycle/depth `ServiceError`
contract, but only because Legacy still exists to honor it. Phase 5 still
needs to delete Legacy and the build-time `PLNG001` diagnostic fully takes
over.

### The design problem (open)

`[VariableName]` is **not** plain legacy — it's a distinct semantic. For
`list/get %products% 0`, the handler needs the *literal name* `"products"` to
call `Context.Variables.Get(ListName)` and `Variables.Set(ListName, ...)` on
the write side. If you wrap that property in `Data<string>`, As<T> resolution
walks `%products%` and hands back the *value* — the name is gone. So the
migration is not mechanical.

Options to consider when this branch opens:

1. **A new wrapper** like `VarRef<T>` that exposes both `.Name` (literal) and
   `.Value` (resolved). Replaces `[VariableName] partial string ListName` with
   `partial VarRef<List<object?>> List`. The handler does `Context.Variables.
   Get(List.Name)` for reads and `.Set(List.Name, ...)` for writes.
2. **Carry the name on `Data<T>`** itself. `Data` already has a `Name` field.
   So `partial Data<List<object?>> List` could expose `List.Name` directly,
   no new wrapper needed. Risk: confuses `Data.Name` (the variable's name)
   with the parameter name in the handler.
3. **Keep an attribute under a non-"legacy" name.** Rename `[VariableName]` to
   something like `[Literal]` and keep the special-case emission path. Smallest
   migration cost, but keeps two emission shapes forever — defeats the goal.

Recommendation for the next branch's architect pass: probably (1) — `VarRef<T>`
as a first-class wrapper. The `Data` carrying a name is already overloaded
(it's the variable's name, the parameter's name in some contexts, the .pr
parameter name in others). A separate type makes the semantics explicit.

### Scope

- Design the replacement (architect pass).
- Migrate ~20 handlers to the new shape.
- Delete `PLang.Generators/Emission/Property/Legacy/this.cs`.
- Delete `[VariableName]` attribute and all references.
- Remove `__Resolve<T>`, `__StripPercent`, `__HasParam`, `RawScalarValidations`
  from `PLang.Generators/Emission/Action/this.cs:250-295` and surrounding hooks.
- Remove the `if (__resolutionError != null) return __resolutionError;`
  pre-Run check at line 232 — once Legacy is gone, `__resolutionError` is only
  populated during Run (by Data<T> getters), so the pre-Run check can never
  trip. The post-Run check (added in coder/v6 to close auditor/v1 finding #1)
  is what catches Data<T> resolution failures and stays.

### Why not on `runtime2-generator-obp`

This branch (the one closing auditor/v1) is in landing shape — codeanalyzer/
tester/security/auditor all approved, and the fix for finding #1 is small and
contained. Bolting the [VariableName] migration on top means a new design
pass plus ~20 handler conversions plus a full re-review cycle — too much
churn on a shipping branch. The migration deserves its own architect pass
on a fresh branch.

## 2026-05-02 — Callback (context for callstack design)

Captured during the callstack architect pass. Callback is its own future
branch — this entry exists only so the design constraints it imposes on
callstack are on record.

### Concept

Callback is **state-machine restoration** for stateless flow + durable
execution. An action like:

    - ask user 'What is your name?', vars: %orderId%, write to %name%

returns a `Callback` object instead of blocking. The callback carries
`(goal, step, action, declared-vars, signature)` and is sent over the wire
(e.g., hidden form field, encrypted). When the user submits, the server
verifies the signature, hydrates the declared vars, dispatches at the
resume point with `%name%` set from form data, and continues from there.

The original run's process state is gone by the time the callback returns.
Resume is a fresh execution rooted at the resume point — not a thread/fiber
unblock.

### Settled design points

- **Vars are developer-declared**, not auto-snapshotted. Syntax: `vars: %orderId%`
  on the action. Practical reason: serializing a 1000-row %products% list
  into a hidden form is not viable. The developer carries IDs and re-queries
  the rest.
- **Vars are encrypted on the wire** so the user can't inspect or tamper with
  carried state.
- **Sign `(goal_hash, step, action, vars, expiry)`** — goal_hash means a
  rebuilt goal invalidates outstanding callbacks. Correct security posture:
  if the developer redeploys, in-flight callbacks fail validation rather
  than running against changed code.
- **Errors carry a callback** for "retry from here" — this is the durable
  execution payoff.

### What this means for callstack design (the only thing relevant now)

- **Frame stays OBP.** Frame holds the live `Action` reference; serializers
  for callbacks traverse the OBP graph at serialization time to extract
  `(goal-name, step-index, action-index)`. Do **not** denormalize stable
  IDs onto Frame.
- **Variable snapshot is not a callstack concern.** Callback issues a
  declared-var snapshot via its own mechanism; CallStack neither captures
  nor restores variables for resume.
- **No `Data.Pause` lane needed in callstack work.** Callback issuance is a
  callback-module concern (action returns a Callback as its Data value).
  Doesn't change Ok/Fail dichotomy.

### Open question for Callback's own design pass

When a callback resumes, does the new run's callstack carry a `Cause` link
back to the issuing run's identifier (cross-process causal trace), or is
resume a clean break? Decide on the Callback branch.

## 2026-05-05 — `crypto.encrypt` / `crypto.decrypt` real implementation

The `runtime2-callback` branch ships these two actions as identity
pass-through: input bytes are returned unchanged. The wiring is real
(Callback's `Serialize`/`Deserialize` calls through them; the Channels
Data layer signs the resulting bytes), so when real crypto lands, only
the action handler bodies change.

**Design target:** symmetric AES-256-GCM keyed by the existing
`IKeyProvider`. Both actions take `byte[]` and return `byte[]`.

**Gating:** named the missing PLang runtime features when picking this up
— briefly noted by Ingi as "we have some missing feature in the plang
runtime." Confirm what those are before starting.

**Migration:** none needed. Pass-through callbacks issued under v1 will
not decrypt under real keys, but nothing has shipped to users yet.

## 2026-05-05 — replace `App._statics` with goal-backed dynamic property

`PLang/App/this.cs:108` carries a private
`ConcurrentDictionary<string, ConcurrentDictionary<string, object?>>`
keyed by module name, exposed through `GetStatic(key)`. Inline TODO at the
declaration says "Replace with goal-backed dynamic property" — that
replacement hasn't been written down anywhere as a real follow-up, so
this entry pins it.

**Why it matters now:** the callback design captures `App._statics` as
part of `app.Snapshot()` (snapshot-and-restore bucket, see
`plan/snapshotted-system.md`). The capture is *provisional* — once the
goal-backed dynamic property mechanism lands, statics live there and the
explicit `_statics` snapshot subtree drops out of `ErrorCallback`'s wire
shape. Callback code shouldn't depend on the field name.

**Design target:** dynamic properties scoped to a goal (or app-wide,
addressed via `app.X.Y` like the rest of the config tree) replacing the
flat module-keyed dict. OBP-shaped, addressable by dot-path, snapshots
naturally as a property of whatever `@this` owns it.

**Out of scope here:** the actual implementation. This entry exists so
the callback work doesn't bake the `_statics` field name into anything
load-bearing.

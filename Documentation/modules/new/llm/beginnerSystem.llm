You a documentation expert, read the code from user, understand it.

I need to write documentation for this code. it's for a programming language plang (plang.is). 
here are code examples

```plang
- get public key, write to %publicKey%
- encrypt %content%, write to %encryptedContent%
- decrypt %encryptedContent%, write to %decryptedContent%
- hash %password%, write to %hashedPassword%
... and so on
```

There is a Getting Started.md(https://github.com/PLangHQ/plang/blob/main/Documentation/GetStarted.md) for the ones that haven't created anything(this is already written) just linking to the pages. Install.md(https://github.com/PLangHQ/plang/blob/main/Documentation/Install.md) 

Be straight to the point, avoid flamboyant, like revolutionary, etc. Straight shooter Let begin: How should we structure it

## Documentation structure

This layout is for all **Beginner.md** docs — written for users who know PLang basics but are new to the specific module.

<structure>
# 🧭 **Beginner Documentation Structure (Template for PLang Modules)**


---

### **1. Header & Introduction**

* Start with a clear title and a single-sentence purpose statement (e.g., “This module helps you work with files securely and easily.”).
* Link to:

  * [Getting Started](./Getting%20Started.md)
  * [Install PLang](./Install.md)
* Keep this short — just enough for users to understand the topic and how to begin.

---

### **2. Overview**

* Briefly explain what the module does and when to use it.
* List 5–7 main capabilities in bullet form, using verbs:

  * *Read and write files*
  * *Encrypt and decrypt text*
  * *Send and receive messages*
  * *Work with data formats*, etc.
* Avoid theory; focus on what users *can do*.

---

### **3. Core Examples (Hands-On Sections)**

Each feature gets its own mini-section.
Structure for every feature:

#### **Feature Title (with icon)**

1. **Example code block (PLang syntax)**

   * Always show complete command(s).
   * Use variable-based examples (`%input%`, `%output%`), not hardcoded strings.

2. **One short explanation or tip.**

   * Explain what happens in plain terms.
   * Optional note on safe or common practice.

Example section pattern:

````markdown
### 🔒 Encrypt and Decrypt
```plang
- set %content% = "My text"
- encrypt %content%, write to %encryptedContent%
- decrypt %encryptedContent%, write to %originalContent%
````

Encrypt hides data; decrypt brings it back using the same key.

```

---

### **4. Common Variations**
- If the module supports multiple methods or algorithms, show simple examples for each (not full detail — that’s for Expert.md).  
- Example:
  - “Use `sha256` or `keccak256` for hashing.”  
  - “Choose between JSON and text formats.”  

---

### **5. Best Practices**
Short bullet list (3–6 points) that guides good habits:
- Always store results in variables.  
- Use salt or keys securely.  
- Avoid exposing sensitive data.  
- Check return values when verifying results.

---

### **6. Troubleshooting / Tips**
Optional section if the module has common beginner mistakes:
- Missing variable errors  
- Access denied or permission issues  
- Data not matching expected format  

Example:
> **Tip:** If you see `File not found`, check that your working directory matches where PLang runs.

---

### **7. Next Steps**
Close with a summary and progression path:
- “You now know how to use the main commands of this module.”  
- Link to:  
  - [Expert Guide →](./Expert.md)  
  - Or any related module (e.g., “See Networking for remote encryption.”)

---

### **Tone & Style Rules**
- Keep every section **short, direct, and example-first**.  
- Avoid jargon — describe *what happens*, not *how it’s implemented*.  
- Prefer **verbs over nouns** (“Encrypt this,” not “Encryption occurs”).  
- Don’t document every parameter — just show safe defaults in action.

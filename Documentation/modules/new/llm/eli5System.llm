You a documentation expert, read the code from user, understand it.

I need to write documentation for this code. it's for a programming language plang (plang.is). 
here are code examples

```plang
- get public key, write to %publicKey%
- encrypt %content%, write to %encryptedContent%
- decrypt %encryptedContent%, write to %decryptedContent%
- hash %password%, write to %hashedPassword%
... and so on
```

There is a Getting Started.md(https://github.com/PLangHQ/plang/blob/main/Documentation/GetStarted.md) for the ones that haven't created anything(this is already written) just linking to the pages. Install.md(https://github.com/PLangHQ/plang/blob/main/Documentation/Install.md) 

Be straight to the point, avoid flamboyant, like revolutionary, etc. Straight shooter Let begin: How should we structure it

## Documentation structure

This is for the simplest level of documentation, ELI5.md — users who have installed PLang but haven’t yet built anything meaningful.
It focuses purely on “what you can do” and “how to do it” — with minimal explanation.

<structure>

# 🧸 **ELI5 Documentation Structure (Template for PLang Modules)**


---

### **1. Header & Intro**

* Start with a clear, human-friendly title like
  `# 🧩 File Module (ELI5)` or `# 🔐 Cryptographic Module (ELI5)`.
* One plain sentence explaining purpose:

  > This module helps you work with files — creating, reading, and writing data easily.
* Link to setup docs:
  👉 [Getting Started](./Getting%20Started.md)
  👉 [Install PLang](./Install.md)

---

### **2. What It Does**

A single short paragraph:

> You can use this module to store, protect, and use data safely.

Then a simple bullet list (3–6 items) of core abilities:

* Read and write data
* Encrypt and decrypt secrets
* Generate or check hashes
* Send messages or tokens

Keep it high-level — one line each, no internal details.

---

### **3. Quick Examples (Core Commands)**

Show the most common use cases immediately.
Each should be:

* One to three lines of PLang code
* Followed by one brief description

Example pattern:

````markdown
### 🔒 Encrypt & Decrypt
```plang
- set %text% = "Hello world"
- encrypt %text%, write to %encrypted%
- decrypt %encrypted%, write to %original%
````

Encrypt hides your data. Decrypt brings it back.

```

Repeat this for 4–6 examples (whatever fits the module’s scope):
- Main operation (encrypt, read file, send message, etc.)
- Secondary one (verify, check, delete, etc.)
- Optional helpers (convert, encode, etc.)

Each example should focus on *doing*, not *explaining*.

---

### **4. What You Can Do**
A clean, non-technical checklist summarizing capabilities, e.g.:

> With this module, you can:
> - Encrypt or decrypt text  
> - Hash and verify passwords  
> - Create secure tokens  
> - Check file integrity  

This section replaces long technical lists — it’s for recognition, not reference.

---

### **5. Learn More**
Always end with upgrade paths:
- [For Beginners →](./Beginner.md)  
- [For Experts →](./Expert.md)

Optional note like:
> Start with the Beginner guide to see what each command does in detail.

---

### **Tone & Style Rules**
| Rule | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Keep it visual** | Use emojis or icons in section titles for scannability. |
| **Show, don’t tell** | Every concept should have an example before or instead of an explanation. |
| **No jargon** | Avoid “hash algorithm,” “instance,” “parameter.” Use “makes a fingerprint,” “uses a secret,” etc. |
| **One idea per section** | Short sections keep the doc lightweight. |
| **Always variable-based** | Use `%variables%`, never hardcoded values. |

---

### **Overall Structure Summary**
1. **Header & Intro** — short purpose + setup links  
2. **What It Does** — one paragraph + bullet list  
3. **Quick Examples** — action-focused code snippets  
4. **What You Can Do** — summary of capabilities  
5. **Learn More** — navigation to deeper docs

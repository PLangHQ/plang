User will provide a goal file, write in programming language plang, a natural language programming language

You job is to identify what type of gui user is building, using the content of the goal file, the path of the goal file.

You must identify tables that user describes.
First table must be the main table, then come foreign key tables.

data source is default '*' (system will figure out datasource)
if user prefixes table, that is the datasource, e.g. analytics.hits => datasource: analytics and table: hits

gui:dashboard|analytics|report|kpi|visualization

<guiDescription>
%gui%
</guiDescription>

ask: If you need information from the user, create a question for him. Do not ask more that 3 times

You are an expert “plang” data-model engineer.

Goal  
Generate **one complete, valid plang model file** ready for import into Power BI, based on the inputs below.

Create a README file aimed at data analysts. People who understands data structure, modeling, how their tool works

<userDescription description="business requirements in plain language">
%user%
</userDescription>       

Use <path_to_docs> to choose which docs you would like to read to finish the user request
<path_to_docs>
%files%
<path_to_docs>



<externalDocs>
%summariesDocs%
</externalDocs>

<techSpec>
%techSpec%
</techSpec>

You should create such as

```plang
UserDashboard
- set default value %startDate% = %now-7days%
        %endDate% = %Now.EndOfDay%
- select * from users, write to %users%
- select * from users where created between %startDate% and %endDate%
- select * orders from orders group by..... 
```

```plang
GetUsers
- set %appId% = %Settings.AppId%
- set %data% = { startDate: %now-7days%, endDate:%now%}
- get https://{domain:string}{path:string}{querystring}
    Bearer: %Settings.Bearer%
    data: %data%
    write to %users%
- // from reading the document you determine how to 
  // handle the results and then insert into tables the data
  // insert users name=%user.....%

ParseContent
- trim to link#authentication, write to %content%
```

Create any table that is needed for the model.

```plang
Setup
- create table users, columns:
    name(string, not null)
    age(int, not null), 
    .... // all properties user requests
    created(datetime, not null, default now)
    ....
```


Output rules  
1. Return **only** the finished plang file in a ```plang …``` block—no extra prose.  
2. Follow every constraint in <techSpec>; prefer patterns in <codeExamples>.  
3. Optimise for performance and clarity (avoid repetition, use variables/parameters).  
4. Inline comments **only** when logic is genuinely non-obvious.  
5. Use platform-neutral literals (`"\n"`, `/` separators).  
6. If a required detail is missing, insert a `TODO:` comment rather than guessing.

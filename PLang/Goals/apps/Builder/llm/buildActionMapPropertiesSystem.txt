You job is to understand user intent and map it to <properties>

For error handling, user would structure it as 'on error...'
For caching, user would structure it 'cache for ...'
For cancellation, user would structure it as 'cancel after ...'
For event binding, user would structure it as 'before step runs...' 

These are example, you must understand the intent of the user and if it maps to these intents.

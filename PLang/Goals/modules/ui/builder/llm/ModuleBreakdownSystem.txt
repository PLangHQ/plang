User provides block of HTML code, and I'd like to break it into logical modules or sections. 
Each module should represent a complete, reusable component like the User profile, Navigation, Header, .... 

Start by making decision on what logical modules or sections there are.
Then rewrite the html and inject those section handle into the original html instead of the section, such as {{ footer }}

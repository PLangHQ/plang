I want you to create BI dashboard, 
I needs to have turnover as line chart, margins as line chart over, 10 newest users with sort when clicking on column calling goal Sort by name

I want you to generate the html, do not use any css link or js
Do not generate javascript

I you need to call a goal, add attribute pl-click="Sort" pl=params="{"sort":"name"}
Generate %variable% when needed, like for numbers
You have d3 javascript library, but do not generate any code. Only html elements that are needed. Name the variables that are needed to create line charts
Write Scriban template language
Tables are lists of data, name the variable {{ foreach }} Scriban syntax

List out all variables and d3 elements
Be concise, just do html and list of variables(json)

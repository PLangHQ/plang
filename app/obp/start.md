# OBP — Object-Based Pattern

OBP is one rule: **behavior lives on the owner**.

Everything else follows from that.

---

## the rules

### 0. ask what the method wants to do

Before writing a method body, ask: *what does this want to do?*
Name that, then delegate to whoever owns it.

`goal.start()` — what does it want? Run all the steps. All the steps is the **list**. So start the list:

```csharp
public Task<data.@this> start() => step.list.start();
```

Not a loop, not reaching into steps — name the intent ("run the steps"),
find who owns it (`step.list`), and start it. Every method is one of these.

---

### 1. behavior belongs to the owner

The object that owns the data owns all operations on that data.
If a method touches a `goal`, it belongs on `goal`. If it loops the steps, it belongs on `step.list`.

```csharp
// wrong — caller iterates what step.list owns
foreach (var s in goal.step.list)
    await s.start();

// right — the list owns the loop
await goal.step.list.start();
```

**Test:** whose data does this method touch? That's where it lives.

---

### 2. Data<T> in, Data out

Every method boundary uses plang types. No raw C# type crosses a signature.

```csharp
// wrong
void save(string name, int index) { }

// right
Task<data.@this> save(data.@this<text.@this> name, data.@this<number.@this> index)
```

plang types:

| use | never |
|-----|-------|
| `data.@this<text.@this>` | `string` |
| `data.@this<path.@this>` | `string` (path) |
| `data.@this<number.@this>` | `int`, `long`, `double` |
| `data.@this<@bool.@this>` | `bool` |
| `data.@this<dict.@this>` | `Dictionary<,>` |
| `data.@this<plang.list<T>>` | `IReadOnlyList<T>`, `IEnumerable<T>`, bare `plang.list<T>` |

A `plang.list<T>` is a value like any other — it rides wrapped, `data.@this<plang.list<T>>`,
never bare. (Same for any `plang.XX` type.) The one floor exception is the list's
*own* backing constructor, `list<T>(IEnumerable<T> items)`, where raw items become
the list — exactly as `text.@this(string value)` is where a raw string becomes `text`.

**Out is `Data<T>`, or `Data`, or skip:**

- `Task<data.@this<T>>` — the method produces a value of a known type.
  A db read returns `Data<table>`, `math.add` returns `Data<number>`. **If the
  type is known, the signature must say it** — never widen a known `Data<T>` to
  bare `Data`. The return type is the method's promise; keep it specific.
- `Task<data.@this>` (bare) — *only* when the value is genuinely polymorphic, or
  the method forwards a `Data` produced elsewhere (a relay must stay bare — see
  rule 8). `goal.start()` is bare because the last step's type isn't known until
  runtime; `math.add` is `Data<number>` because it always is.
- **skip** — the method isn't data-bearing: a predicate (`bool is(...)`), a
  navigation property, a `void` side-effect. Don't wrap these in `Data` for
  its own sake.

The choice is the signature's job. Never a raw C# value dressed as a result.

---

### 3. navigate, don't pass

Reach through the object graph. Never decompose an object into separate parameters.

```csharp
// wrong — caller decomposes file before passing
find(file.path, file.name)

// right — pass the object, let the receiver navigate
find(file)
```

And the receiver decides what it needs — not the caller.

---

### 3a. need context? implement IContext — never pass it

The execution context (variables, callstack, current goal/step) is **not** a
method parameter. A class that needs it declares `IContext`; the runtime
injects `Context`. Threading context through every signature is the friction
OBP exists to kill.

```csharp
// wrong — context threaded through the call chain
Task<data.@this> start(context.@this context) => action.list.start(context);

// right — start() stays clean; the class that needs context asks for it
class read : IContext {
    public context.@this Context { get; set; }   // injected
    public Task<data.@this> Run() {
        var path = Context.Variable.Get("path");
        ...
    }
}
```

Only leaf actions that actually touch context implement `IContext`. A `goal`,
a `step`, a `step.list` never see it — they just `start()`.

See [context](../context/start.md) for what context holds.

---

### 4. names describe what the object IS

Properties are nouns. Methods are verbs. The name tells you what the thing is.

```
goal.steps        — "the steps"
step.actions      — "the actions"
file.path         — "the path"
```

Not:
```
goal.getSteps()   — "get" is redundant, steps IS the thing
manager.run()     — manager of what?
io.process()      — process what?
```

**Rule:** if you need `Get`/`Manager`/`Service`/`Helper` in the name, the shape is wrong.
The method is missing from the type that owns the data.

---

### 5. the list owns the loop — and there are no plurals

Every collection is its own type. It owns iteration, short-circuiting, and ordering.
The parent delegates — it never loops directly.

```csharp
// wrong — parent loops
foreach (var a in step.action.list)
    await a.start();

// right — the list owns the loop
await step.action.list.start();
```

**The collection is `X.list`, never a plural.** A goal's steps are
`goal.step.list`, not `goal.steps`. A step's actions are `step.action.list`,
not `step.actions`. The singular name is the concept; `.list` is the collection
of them. This mirrors the navigation root: `app.goal.list`, `app.goal["Start"]`,
`app.goal.current`.

The list's own field is named for what it contains:

```csharp
// wrong
list(list<goal> items)

// right
list(list<goal> goals)
```

---

### 6. the item knows itself

A list never reaches inside an item to match it.
The item answers questions about itself.

```csharp
// wrong — list decomposes item
files.first(f => f.path.Equals(target))

// right — item knows if it matches
files.first(f => f.is(target))
```

---

### 7. only leaves touch Data.Value

`Data` is a closed package: `{type, value, properties, signature}`.
Courier layers move it, inspect `.Success`, read `.Type` for routing.
They never open `.Value`.

Two things are leaves:
1. **Actions** that declare `Data<T>` — they named the type, they own the open.
2. **Serializers** — the type renders itself per format.

Everything between is courier. A courier that opens the package to branch on `.Value` is a leaf pretending to be a relay.

```csharp
// wrong — courier opens the package
if (data.Value is image img) { ... }

// right — declare the type at the leaf
public Task<data.@this> start(data.@this<image.@this> img) { ... }
```

---

### 8. relay data, don't repackage

`Data` flows. Intermediate layers pass it through unchanged.

```csharp
// wrong — loses type, properties, signature
return data.@this.Ok(result.Value);

// right
return result;
```

---

### 9. no redundant wrappers

If the callee needs what the caller already has, pass the object.
Don't construct a new type that copies the same fields into a different shape.

```csharp
// wrong
var ctx = new EventContext { GoalName = goal.name, Step = step };
await events.run(ctx);

// right
await events.run(goal, step);
```

---

## the smell list

Run this on any method or type. A "yes" means a type is missing — the fix is structural.

1. **Caller iterates a collection it doesn't own** → the loop belongs on the collection
2. **Caller decomposes an object before passing** → pass the object
3. **Raw C# type crosses a method boundary** → wrap in `Data<T>`
4. **`GetX`, `Manager`, `Service`, `Helper` in a name** → behavior on the wrong type
5. **Courier reads `.Value`** → declare the type at the leaf or forward as-is
6. **Same transform at 3+ call sites** (`f.path.TrimStart('/')` everywhere) → property on the owner
7. **Two fields that mirror a reference** (`goal.name` + `goal.goal.name`) → delete the flat copy
8. **`IReadOnlyList<T>`, `IEnumerable<T>`, or a bare `plang.list<T>` in a signature** → a list is a value; ride it as `data.@this<plang.list<T>>`
9. **Constructor does I/O** → defer to first access
10. **`lock(other.X)` from outside X** → the lock belongs on X
11. **`context` passed as a parameter** → implement `IContext`, let it be injected
12. **A plural property name** (`steps`, `actions`, `goals`) → the concept is singular, the collection is `X.list`
13. **Returns bare `Data` but always builds a known type** → declare `Data<T>`; the return type is the promise
